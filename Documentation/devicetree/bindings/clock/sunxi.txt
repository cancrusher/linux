Device Tree Clock bindings for arch-sunxi

This binding uses the common clock binding[1].

[1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

Required properties:
- compatible : shall be one of the following:
	"allwinner,sunxi-osc-clk" - for a gatable oscillator
	"allwinner,sunxi-pll1-clk" - for the main PLL clock
	"allwinner,sunxi-cpu-clk" - for the CPU multiplexer clock
	"allwinner,sunxi-axi-clk" - for the sunxi AXI clock
	"allwinner,sunxi-ahb-clk" - for the sunxi AHB clock
	"allwinner,sunxi-apb0-clk" - for the sunxi APB0 clock

Required properties for all clocks:
- reg : shall be the control register address for the clock.
- clocks : shall be the input parent clock(s) phandle for the clock, except for
	the root gatable oscillator clock where it is not present
- #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 0.

Additionally, the gatable oscillator clock requires:
- clock-frequency : shall be the frequency of the oscillator.


For example:

osc24M: osc24M {
	#clock-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "allwinner,sunxi-osc-clk";
	reg = <0x01c20050 0x4>;
	clock-frequency = <24000000>;
};

pll1: pll1@01c20000 {
	#clock-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "allwinner,sunxi-pll1-clk";
	reg = <0x01c20000 0x4>;
	clocks = <&osc24M>;
};

cpu: cpu@01c20054 {
	#clock-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "allwinner,sunxi-cpu-clk";
	reg = <0x01c20054 0x4>;
	clocks = <&osc32k>, <&osc24M>, <&pll1>;
};
